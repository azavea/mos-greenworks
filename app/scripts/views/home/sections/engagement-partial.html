    <h3>Lower City Government Energy Consumption by 30 Percent</h3>
    <hr class="hr-subheader">
    <p>City government energy usage rose in 2013 for the first time since 2007. As shown in the chart on the facing page, energy usage rises and falls with changes in weather, as extreme temperatures force heating and cooling systems to work longer and harder, increasing energy usage both at the municipal level and citywide. The Mayorâ€™s Office of Sustainability (MOS) is currently working to weather-normalize energy data to provide a more accurate picture of municipal energy efficiency.</p>
